<h2 align="center">Encore Decks</h2>

[encoredecks.com](https://encoredecks.com) is an open source database and deck building application for the popular TCG [Weiss Schwarz](https://en.ws-tcg.com/), created by **Bushiroad Inc.** I created this project for the benefit of the Weiss Schwarz community, and not with the intent of monetary gain.

## Roadmap

There is a [Trello](https://trello.com/b/eQnnH19k/encoredecks) that is kept up to date with what things are planned and need to be worked on.

## How can I help?

Since encoredecks is open source, that means any one can help, just open a pull request! You can work any things in the roadmap above, or something you think adds value (Talk to me first).

Non programmers can help with the following:

 - Card translations (@BoatsDon'tSink for details)
 - Site design or ideas
